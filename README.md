**Civil Proxy**

Easily-reproducible anonymous web proxy fueled by both pure JavaScript (coming soon) and Ultraviolet.

**Note:** Based on a lot of feedback from my friends @PrestonT500 and @accessgames, there will be an alternative Ultraviolet-powered version of Civil in a couple months! This repo will still be frequently updated, though.

### Note

Domains like google.com do a really good job of obfuscating the HTML `href` and `src` attributes. If any google.com subdomain/page has broken image links or there are some parts of the site that straight-up don't work, please fork and open a pull request.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- State what you want to happen in any `.md` or text file.

- Use code blocks like this if necessary:

```
Replace me
```

### Issue Guidelines

In my opinion, pull requests are far more productive in an environment like this than issues, so please don't open issues if pages aren't working.

However, you can open issues for:

- Improvements/code suggestions

- Security vulnerabilities
